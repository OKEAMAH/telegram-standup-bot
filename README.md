2. Type `/subscribe` in each of those chats to start receiving updates.

## üóìÔ∏è Schedule

- Reminders to submit updates sent at 10AM EST.
- Updates posted at 11AM EST.

## üîß Support

## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosting Setup

1. Install Vercel CLI: `yarn global add vercel`
2. Set up the project with Vercel: `vercel deploy` (accept all default settings)
3. Create a Telegram bot with BotFather: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather
4. Add your Telegram bot API key as an environment variable: `vercel env add TELEGRAM_API_KEY`
5. Create a database instance with MongoDB Atlas (name your database "standup"): https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
6. Add your MongoDB URI as an environment variable: `vercel env add MONGODB_FULL_URI`
7. Pull down the environment variables as a local `.env` file for local development: `vercel env pull`
8. Set up a webhook to your Vercel standup URL: https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_API_KEY}/setWebhook?url=https://.../api/standup?key=${TELEGRAM_API_KEY}

## üíª Local Development

```bash
yarn
vercel dev
```

This runs the website at localhost:3000 and runs your Lambda functions in the /api folder on localhost:3000/api. For more information, check out Vercel's Serverless Functions Introduction.

## üîé Troubleshooting

If your messages or commands aren't going through, check for any pending updates and read the error. You may have to fix the error, or it will happen again.

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_API_KEY}/getWebhookInfo
https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_API_KEY}/deleteWebhook?drop_pending_updates=true
```

To view your function logs in Vercel, log in to Vercel, navigate to your bot, click on your functions, and then view the function logs.
